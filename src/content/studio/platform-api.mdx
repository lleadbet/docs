description: Automate Studio tasks in your own code

> ⚠️ **The Platform API is currently in public preview.** It might introduce breaking changes before its general availability release. [Learn more about release stages.](/resources/release-stages#cloud-release-stages)

The Apollo Platform API enables you to perform Apollo Studio tasks from your own custom application. These tasks include:

* Fetching details about Studio graphs
* Registering schemas to new or existing graph variants
* Running [schema checks](./schema-checks/) and obtaining their results
* Removing variants from a graph
* Removing subgraphs from a supergraph

The Platform API is itself represented as a public graph in Apollo Studio. Most documentation for the API (including a README and a collection of example operations) is available in Studio.
